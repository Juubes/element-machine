# ElementMachine

ElementMachine is a web development practise project based on some existing games such as Little Alchemy. The idea is to over engineer a scalable cloud-based backend with NextJS, Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

# Idea

The game's idea is that player's in the multiplayer game can combine "elements" with any other elements and get new elements as a result. If a combination doesn't yet exist, a player can name it themselves.

<!-- # Technical -->

# Known caveats

- The game doesn't implement any user input validation regarding naming new elements. Yeah... This is gonna be interesting.
